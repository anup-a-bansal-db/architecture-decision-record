Format:

- \[Use Case Name\]\(URL\)

Add explanations if the ADR is not addressing all the requirements of a use case.


## Context

Describe:

- how the design is architecturally significant - warranting an ADR (versus simple issue and PR to fix a problem)

- the high level design approach (details described in the proposed design below)


## Proposed Design

Details of the design (without getting into implementation where possible).

Outline:

- services/modules to be impacted (changed)

- new services/modules to be added

- model and DTO impact (changes/additions/removals)

- API impact (changes/additions/removals)

- general configuration impact (establishment of new sections, changes/additions/removals)

- devops impact


## Considerations

Document alternatives, concerns, ancillary or related issues, questions that arose in debate of the ADR. 

Indicate if/how they were resolved or mollified.
* [option 1]

* â€¦ <!-- numbers of options can vary -->


## Decision

What is the change that we're proposing and/or doing?
